# data_pycovery
A crappy but opensource data recovery option.
Also able to secure-wipe empty clusters, while leaving existing files alone.

Currently only supports NTFS on Windows.
Install python (Made for python 3.12.4), run the script and follow the prompts.
If you just want to recover files, enter the drive letter then hit enter a couple of times.

Formats currently recovered during scan:
7z, exe, jpg, mp3, pdf, png, txt, zip
